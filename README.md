###

<br clear="both">

<p align="left">Numerical study investigates the influence of slot span on the aerodynamic characteristics of a NACA 4412 airfoil, showing that the presence of a slot near the trailing edge reduced drag. and improve aerodynamic performance, reduce risks of stalling and spinning, and have implications for various applications such as aircraft wings, wind turbine blades, and watercraft.</p>

###

<br clear="both">

<p align="left">Film cooling is a widely used technique to protect surfaces from high temperatures, commonly used in aircraft nozzles and turbine blades.A numerical simulation was conducted to study the effect of shock waves on supersonic film cooling, and a slotted wall design was found to be effective in reducing this effect.</p>
