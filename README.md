## üîß PROJECTS

### Inverted Search - Emertxe

The Inverted Index Project aims to implement efficient inverted search functionality using Hash Algorithms, enabling fast full‚Äëtext searches by initially indexing words with document details using datastructures like sorted Linked Lists or Hash Tables, and thenfacilitating quick querying andretrieval of documents containing queried words.
* Concepts: Hashing, Single linked list, File Handling
* Technical Skills: Linux, C, Data Structure.
  
### Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) - Emertxe : 

Project in C explores calculations with numbers of unlimited precision, implemented using a linkedlist‚Äëbased Abstract Data Type (ADT),focusing on operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power, essential for applications like public‚Äëkey cryptography and computing extensive mathematical constants such as œÄ.
* Concepts: Ordercomplexity, Applying Abstract Data Types (ADT), Self‚Äëreferential structures using linked list
* Technical Skills: Linux, C.
### AddressBook - Emertxe

A command ‚Äë line application developed in C,manages contact in formation such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses using standard I/O operations, featuring functionalities for adding, searching, editing contacts, saving data, and exiting the application.
* Technical Skills: Linux, C.
 
### [MP3 Tag Reader](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/docs/en/viewer.md) - Emertxe :

 ‚Ä¢ Acommand‚Äëline application developed in C, reads and displays ID3 tag information from MP3 files, distinguishing between ID3v1 and ID3v2
 versions, with potential for future expansion into a tag editor.‚Äù
 * Concepts: Function pointers, String operations, File I/O handling.
 * Technical Skills: Linux, C.
   
### LSB Image Steganography Project -  Emertxe
 
Developed a command‚Äëline tool for LSB (Least Significant Bit) image steganography. The application supports BMP images and text files for embedding messages, ensuring compatibility by analyzing file sizes. It includes an option to embed a magic string for identification purposes andsupports decryption to retrieve hidden messages.
 * Concepts: Function pointers, File I/O operations, Bitwise operations.
 * Technical Skills: Linux, C.
   
### Oxygen Concentrator [Final year project] -  MarBaselios College of Engineering And Technology

Developed a sustainable oxygen concentrator to address the oxygen shortage during the COVID‚Äë19 pandemic sponsored by TVS motors cosponsor by HLL Lifecare.Focused on ensuring a steady oxygen supply in low‚Äëresource settings.
* Technical Skills: SolidWorks, CatiaV5, Ansys.
* SoftSkills: TimeManagement,Teamwork,Presentationskills, Report writing

### Numerical Study on the Effect of Slot Spanon Wing Performance of a NACA4412 Airfoil -  MarBaselios College of Engineering And Technology

Investigates the influence of slot span on aerodynamic characteristics of a NACA 4412 airfoil. Presenceofaslot near the trailing edge to Reduces drag, Improves aerodynamic performance and Reduces risks of stalling and spinning.
* Technical Skills: SolidWorks, CatiaV5, Ansys.
* SoftSkills: TimeManagement,Teamwork,Presentationskills, Report writing.
### Effect of Shock Waves on Supersonic Film Cooling with Rectangular and Triangular Slotted Wall - MarBaselios College of Engineering And Technology

Examined the effect of shock waves on supersonic filmcooling and Found slotted wall design effective in reducing the effect of shock waves. Filmcooling protects surfaces from high temperatures.
Improves its aerodynamic performance compared to the standard version without a slot. Aerodynamic performance refers to how well the airfoil generates lift and minimizes drag, which are important factors in determining the efficiency and stability of an aircraft.
